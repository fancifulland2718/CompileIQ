# CompileIQ - NVIDIA Compiler HPO

**Push GPU kernels further with NVIDIA compiler tuning.**

CompileIQ is a hyperparameter optimizer for NVIDIA compiler controls and application parameters. It helps kernel developers tune those controls against workload-specific benchmarks, adding another optimization path for CUDA C++, Triton, and Helion kernels after source-level tuning has plateaued.

[Documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/CompileIQ/stable/) | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/compileiq/) | [Latest Release](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CompileIQ/releases/latest) | [Search Space Catalog Releases](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CompileIQ/releases?q=Search+Space+Catalog+Release&expanded=true) | [Booster Pack Catalog Releases](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CompileIQ/releases?q=Booster+Pack+Catalog+Release&expanded=true)

## What CompileIQ Does

CompileIQ tunes NVIDIA compilers to your workload using the compiler's [Advanced Controls](https://nvidia.github.io/CompileIQ/stable/compilers_overview.html) interface. At a high level CompileIQ:

- Searches optimal PTXAS and NVCC Advanced Controls for your target kernel.
- Iteratively measures candidates against metrics defined by you (runtime, compile time, power, etc).
- Produces an Advanced Control File (ACF) that can be distributed with the kernel.
- Supports CUDA C++, Triton, and Helion tuning workflows.

## Basic Workflow

1. Define the kernel benchmark and objective.
2. Run CompileIQ over the relevant compiler controls.
3. Apply the generated ACF in future builds or JIT compilation.

Tune the compiler to the workload.

See the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/CompileIQ/stable/) and [examples](#examples) for more.

## Quick install

You can either install through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/compileiq/):

```bash
pip install compileiq
```

Or, build from the the source in this repository yourself:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Supported platforms

CompileIQ supports Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. Published wheels include the
bundled CompileIQ core for Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, and Windows amd64.

Linux wheels target glibc 2.34 or newer and are tagged `manylinux_2_34`. See
the [installation guide](docs/install.md) for Linux runtime library
requirements and Windows runtime notes.

## Search Spaces

CompileIQ can retrieve curated compiler search spaces from GitHub release assets and cache them locally. Use `PtxasSearchSpace` or `NvccSearchSpace` to select a compiler, compiler version, and optional variant:

```python
from compileiq.search_spaces.compilers import PtxasSearchSpace

search_space = PtxasSearchSpace(version="13.3", variant="att")
```

For reproducible runs, pin a search-space release tag:

```python
search_space = PtxasSearchSpace(version="13.3", tag="search-spaces-2026.05.05")
```

Set `CIQ_SEARCH_SPACES_DIR` to use a local mirror containing `manifest.json` plus the referenced `.bin` files. Set `CIQ_SEARCH_SPACES_REPO` to test or use a different release repository.

Browse the published [Search Space Catalog Releases](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CompileIQ/releases?q=Search+Space+Catalog+Release&expanded=true) to inspect available catalog assets and release notes.

## Taichi Forge fork extension

The `forge/opaque-recipes-v1` branch adds a provider-neutral opaque recipe
domain for Taichi Forge high-level optimization plans. It is deliberately
separate from CompileIQ's ordinary PTXAS/NVCC search-space support. See
[Taichi Forge opaque recipes](docs/taichi_forge_opaque_recipes.md) for the
capability lock, worker contracts, build procedure, and integration boundary.

## Environment Configuration Options

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Type | Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| CIQ_SOCKET_TIMEOUT | 20 | int | Controls how long CompileIQ waits for a core response. If you experience timeouts because your search space is too big, consider increasing this value.
| CIQ_KEEP_CACHE | False | bool | If set to True, `.cache` files will not be deleted.
| CIQ_PROCESS_MODE | "forkserver" | str | Start method for process-based workers. Set to "fork" for tighter process separation when threads are involved. `IsoMultiProcessWorker` defaults to "fork" independently.
| CIQ_SEARCH_SPACES_DIR | unset | path | Reads compiler search-space `manifest.json` and `.bin` files from a local mirror instead of GitHub.
| CIQ_SEARCH_SPACES_REPO | NVIDIA/CompileIQ | str | GitHub repository used for search-space release lookups, useful for staging or a future dedicated asset repo.

## Examples

The `examples/` folder has simple examples for you to get started on using CompileIQ.

For the full user guide, see the [CompileIQ documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/CompileIQ/stable/).

If you are planning on running examples, you may need additional dependencies:

```bash
python -m poetry install --with examples
```

## Documentation development

Install the docs dependencies once:

```bash
make install-docs
```

To preview uncommitted documentation edits from your live worktree:

```bash
make docs-preview
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/main/>.

If port 8000 is already in use, stop the existing local docs server first.

Use `make docs` or `make docs-serve` when you need to test the multiversion
documentation shape used by GitHub Pages. Those commands build from Git refs, so
they are not the right choice for checking dirty worktree edits before commit.
